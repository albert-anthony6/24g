## project Schema

Project can be cloned at https://github.com/albert-anthony6/24g. 

Please note that if run locally, some changes may need to be made such as allowing access to any port other than 8082.
To change the allowed port, please go to app.js in the backend folder and change app.use(cors({credentials: true, origin: 'http://localhost:8082'})); on line 20 to be your desired local port number.

Also note that github code may not include the local url path needed to run app locally; in order to fix, please include http://localhost:8000 in the API call functions located in the following client folder files...

- /src/pages/Home.page.vue

- /src/components/SelectedVideo.component.vue

- /src/components/SignIn.component.vue

- /src/components/SignUp.component.vue

- /src/components/Header.component.vue

Google Drive link should include all hidden files from gitignore if needed. Connection with the database is made via mongoose and mongoDB atlas.
